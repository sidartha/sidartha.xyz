Hello! My name is Sidartha and in May, I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Here's my favorite picture from commencement: ![Sidartha at commencement in May 2021](./sidartha-commencement.jpg "Â© Christopher Moore, Georgia Institute of Technology")

After graduation, I took a trip to Washington, D.C. (my first time there!) and New York City. Since then, I have moved back home to Petaling Jaya, Malaysia (after spending two weeks at a hotel serving my mandatory quarantine, where I had a lot of free time to create this blog). I have also begun my full-time career as a Software Engineer at Astro, Malaysia's leading content and entertainment company.

A little about me: I enjoy experimenting with computers (my friends and family members consider me their personal technical support rep). Over the last year, I've also dabbled at photography, attempting to capture people, cities, and nature. 

I hope to share information about my side projects, thoughts about technology, and photos from my photography journey. 

Please feel free to reach out by emailing me at sr@sidartha.xyz.
